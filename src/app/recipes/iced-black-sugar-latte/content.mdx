## Preparation Steps

1. Prepare a 12 oz cold cup with ice, filling it about 2/3 full.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Drink is too sweet**: Reduce the amount of black sugar syrup or increase the espresso.
2. **Coffee taste is weak**: Ensure proper espresso extraction or add slightly more espresso.
3. **Syrup doesn't mix well**: Stir more vigorously after adding the espresso.
4. **Drink is watery**: Use less ice or add more espresso and milk.
5. **Inconsistent flavor**: Use a scale to measure ingredients precisely, especially the syrup.
6. **Espresso tastes bitter**: Check grind size and extraction time, aiming for 25-30 seconds for a double shot.
