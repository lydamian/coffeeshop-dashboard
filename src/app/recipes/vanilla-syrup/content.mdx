# Vanilla Syrup

Vanilla syrup is a staple in specialty coffee shops, adding sweet, aromatic complexity to various drinks. Originating from vanilla's use in early coffee houses, it's now a key ingredient in lattes, cold brews, and more. Made from sugar, water, and vanilla, it offers a smooth, creamy flavor profile with floral notes. It's one of the most popular flavoring syrups, used in approximately 30% of flavored coffee drinks in American cafes.

## Ingredients and Equipment

### Ingredients:
- Granulated sugar
- Water
- Whole vanilla beans or vanilla paste

### Equipment:
- Medium saucepan
- Measuring cups
- Kitchen scale
- Wooden spoon or silicone spatula
- Fine-mesh strainer
- 24oz squeeze bottle
- Funnel (optional)
- Knife (for splitting vanilla beans)

## Steps to Make Vanilla Syrup

1. If using whole vanilla beans, split them lengthwise and scrape out the seeds.
2. Combine water and sugar in the saucepan.
3. Add vanilla seeds and pods (or vanilla paste) to the mixture.
4. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves completely.
5. Bring to a simmer and let it cook for about 5 minutes.
6. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
7. Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer into the squeeze bottle.
8. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2-4 weeks.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Syrup crystallizing**: Ensure all sugar is dissolved during cooking. If crystallization occurs, gently reheat the syrup.

2. **Weak vanilla flavor**: Increase the amount of vanilla or let the syrup steep longer before straining.

3. **Syrup too thick**: Add a small amount of hot water and stir until desired consistency is reached.

4. **Syrup too thin**: Simmer the syrup for a few more minutes to reduce and thicken it.

5. **Mold growth**: Always use clean utensils and bottles. If mold appears, discard the syrup immediately.

6. **Separation in cold drinks**: This is normal. Shake the drink or stir well before serving.

## Raw info
### Recipes for 24oz (710ml) squeeze bottles of vanilla syrup using both raw vanilla beans and vanilla paste, in both 2:1 and 1:1 sugar to water ratios.


#### Raw Vanilla Bean Recipes:



##### 2:1 Ratio (Richer, Sweeter Syrup):
Ingredients:



2-3 whole vanilla beans

1 cup (240ml) water

2 cups (400g) granulated sugar



##### 1:1 Ratio (Thinner, Less Sweet Syrup):
Ingredients:



2-3 whole vanilla beans

1.5 cups (360ml) water

1.5 cups (300g) granulated sugar


Instructions for both ratios:



Split the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape out the seeds.

In a saucepan, combine water, sugar, vanilla seeds, and the empty vanilla pods.

Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.

Bring to a simmer and let it cook for about 5 minutes.

Remove from heat and let it cool completely.

Strain the syrup into your 24oz squeeze bottle.


#### Vanilla Paste Recipes:



##### 2:1 Ratio (Richer, Sweeter Syrup):
Ingredients:



2-3 tablespoons vanilla paste

1 cup (240ml) water

2 cups (400g) granulated sugar



##### 1:1 Ratio (Thinner, Less Sweet Syrup):
Ingredients:



2-3 tablespoons vanilla paste

1.5 cups (360ml) water

1.5 cups (300g) granulated sugar


Instructions for both ratios:



In a saucepan, combine water, sugar, and vanilla paste.

Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.

Bring to a simmer and let it cook for about 5 minutes.

Remove from heat and let it cool completely.

Pour the syrup into your 24oz squeeze bottle (no need to strain).


Notes:



For the vanilla paste versions, start with 2 tablespoons and taste after cooling. Add more if desired.

The amount of vanilla (beans or paste) can be adjusted to taste.

Both types will last about 2-4 weeks when refrigerated, with the 2:1 ratio potentially lasting slightly longer due to higher sugar content.

The 2:1 ratio will yield a slightly smaller volume but more concentrated syrup.

The 1:1 ratio will be easier to mix into cold drinks and closer to commercial syrup consistency.


Experiment with these variations to find your perfect vanilla syrup for coffee drinks!
