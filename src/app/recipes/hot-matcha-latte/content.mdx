# Hot Matcha Latte

Hot Matcha Latte is a popular beverage that combines the earthy, umami flavors of Japanese green tea powder with the creamy sweetness of steamed milk and a touch of syrup. Originating from traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, matcha has found its way into modern coffee shops, offering a caffeine boost with unique health benefits. The drink consists of ceremonial grade matcha powder, hot water, steamed milk, and a hint of sweetener, resulting in a smooth, vibrant green latte with a rich, slightly sweet, and grassy flavor profile. According to recent surveys, matcha lattes have seen a 200% increase in popularity in American specialty coffee shops over the past five years.

## Ingredients and Equipment

Ingredients:
- Ceremonial grade matcha powder
- Hot water (175°F/80°C)
- Milk (dairy or plant-based)
- Syrup (e.g., simple syrup or flavored syrup)

Equipment:
- Matcha bowl (chawan)
- Bamboo whisk (chasen)
- Matcha sifter
- Kettle
- Serving latte cup (8-9 oz)
- Milk steaming pitcher
- Espresso machine with steam wand or milk frother
- Syrup pump or measuring spoon

## Instructions

1. Add 19g of syrup to an 8-9 oz serving latte cup.
2. Sift 4g of matcha powder into the matcha bowl to remove any clumps.
3. Add 30ml of hot water (175°F/80°C) to the bowl.
4. Using the bamboo whisk, vigorously whisk the matcha and water in a "W" motion for about 1 minute until frothy and smooth, ensuring no clumps remain.
5. Pour the matcha mixture into the serving latte cup with syrup.
6. Add a small amount of hot water to the matcha bowl, swirl to collect any residual matcha, and pour into the latte cup.
7. Steam 180ml of milk to 150-160°F (65-70°C), creating a velvety microfoam.
8. Slowly pour the steamed milk into the latte cup, allowing the foam to settle on top.
9. Optional: Create latte art with the milk foam.
10. Stir gently to incorporate the syrup and serve immediately.

## Troubleshooting

1. Clumpy matcha: Sift the matcha powder before whisking and ensure vigorous whisking.
2. Bitter taste: Use water at 175°F (80°C), not boiling, as it can make the matcha bitter.
3. Weak flavor: Increase the amount of matcha powder slightly or reduce the milk quantity.
4. Grainy texture: Use higher quality, ceremonial grade matcha and whisk thoroughly.
5. Inconsistent color: Ensure the matcha is fully dissolved before adding milk.
6. Scalded milk: Steam milk to 150-160°F (65-70°C) to avoid burning and maintain sweetness.
7. Flat latte art: Practice proper milk steaming technique to achieve the right microfoam consistency.
8. Too sweet or not sweet enough: Adjust the amount of syrup to taste.
9. Syrup not mixing well: Stir the drink gently after adding all ingredients to ensure even distribution of syrup.
