# Iced Latte

The Iced Latte is a refreshing espresso-based drink that has become a staple in American coffee shops. Originating in the 1980s as a chilled version of the classic latte, it combines the rich flavor of espresso with cold milk and ice. Made with espresso and cold milk, then served over ice, it offers a smooth, creamy taste with a strong coffee kick. The drink's flavor profile is characterized by a balanced blend of bold espresso and creamy milk, with the coolness of ice enhancing its refreshing quality. In many American specialty coffee shops, Iced Lattes account for approximately 20-25% of cold coffee drink orders, especially during warmer months.

## Ingredients and Equipment

Ingredients:
- Espresso beans
- Cold milk (whole, 2%, or alternative milk)
- Ice cubes

Equipment:
- Espresso machine
- Grinder
- Scale
- Shot glasses or espresso cups
- 12-16 oz serving cup (to accommodate ice)
- Measuring cup
- Ice scoop
- Long spoon for stirring (optional)

## Steps to Make an Iced Latte

1. Prepare the serving glass by filling it about 2/3 full with ice.
2. Grind the espresso beans fresh for a double shot (about 18-20g).
3. Pull a double shot of espresso (2 oz) using your espresso machine.
4. In a measuring cup, add the freshly brewed espresso.
5. Add cold milk to the measuring cup until it reaches the 9 oz mark.
6. Stir gently to combine the espresso and milk.
7. Pour the mixture over the ice in the serving glass.
8. Serve immediately, optionally with a straw.

## Troubleshooting

1. Weak coffee flavor: Ensure you're using the correct amount of espresso (2 oz). If still weak, try using a darker roast or adjusting your grind size for a stronger extraction.

2. Too strong: If the coffee taste is overpowering, add a little more milk or use less espresso in future preparations.

3. Milk curdling: This can happen if the espresso is too hot when mixed with cold milk. Let the espresso cool slightly before combining with milk, or try pouring the milk over the ice first, then adding the espresso.

4. Inconsistent taste: Standardize your process by using a scale to measure your espresso and a measuring cup for the milk. Ensure your espresso shots are consistent in volume and extraction time.

5. Drink is too watery: Use larger ice cubes that melt more slowly, or slightly reduce the amount of milk to account for ice melt.

6. Layered drink instead of mixed: If you prefer a more uniform mixture, stir the drink gently after pouring. If you like the layered look, pour the milk over the back of a spoon onto the espresso.

7. Temperature issues: If the drink isn't cold enough, pre-chill your serving glass or use cold milk straight from the refrigerator.

8. Foam problems: If you want a bit of foam on top, you can shake the milk in a cocktail shaker with ice before pouring, or use a milk frother to create cold foam to top the drink.
