# How to Prepare a Cappuccino at RU Coffee Bar

A cappuccino is a classic espresso-based drink consisting of espresso and steamed milk, topped with a small layer of milk foam. In specialty coffee shops, the focus is on balance and quality of ingredients.

export const CappuccinoCalculator = () => {
  const [espressoOz, setEspressoOz] = useState(2);
  const [steamedMilkOz, setSteamedMilkOz] = useState(4);
  const [totalVolume, setTotalVolume] = useState(6);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTotalVolume(espressoOz + steamedMilkOz);
  }, [espressoOz, steamedMilkOz]);

  const updateValues = (type, value) => {
    switch(type) {
      case 'espresso':
        setEspressoOz(value);
        setSteamedMilkOz(6 - value);
        break;
      case 'steamedMilk':
        setSteamedMilkOz(value);

## Ingredients and Equipment

- Espresso (see <Link href="/recipes/espresso">Espresso Recipe</Link>)
- Whole milk
- Espresso machine with steam wand
- Milk pitcher
- 6 oz cappuccino cup

## Steps to Prepare a Cappuccino

1. **Prepare the espresso**
   - Follow the <Link href="/recipes/espresso">Espresso Recipe</Link> to pull a 2 oz double shot

2. **Steam the milk**
   - Refer to the <Link href="/recipes/steamed-milk">Steamed Milk Guide</Link> for technique
   - For a cappuccino, create a velvety microfoam with small, tight bubbles
   - Steam about 4 oz of milk to 140-150°F (60-65°C)

3. **Combine and serve**
   - Pour the espresso into a 6 oz cappuccino cup
   - Gently pour the steamed milk over the espresso, allowing a small layer of foam to form on top
   - Aim for a ratio of 1/3 espresso to 2/3 steamed milk, with a thin layer of foam on top

## Cappuccino Art

In specialty coffee shops, latte art is often applied to cappuccinos:

1. Start with the cup at a slight angle
2. Pour the milk steadily into the center of the espresso
3. As the cup fills, bring the pitcher closer to the surface
4. Create patterns by moving the pour in a steady motion
5. Finish with a gentle cut through for more intricate designs

## Tips for the Perfect Specialty Cappuccino

1. **Espresso quality**: Use freshly roasted, high-quality beans and dial in your grind and extraction
2. **Milk texture**: Focus on creating silky, velvety microfoam without large bubbles
3. **Temperature**: Serve immediately for the best flavor and texture
4. **Balance**: Maintain a 1:2 ratio of espresso to steamed milk for a modern specialty cappuccino
5. **Consistency**: Practice your milk steaming and pouring techniques regularly

Remember, in specialty coffee, the emphasis is on highlighting the quality of the espresso while achieving a harmonious balance with perfectly textured milk. The modern specialty cappuccino typically has less foam and a higher milk-to-espresso ratio compared to traditional Italian cappuccinos.
