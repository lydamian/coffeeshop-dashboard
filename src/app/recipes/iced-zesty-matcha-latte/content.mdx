# Zesty Iced Matcha Latte

The Zesty Iced Matcha Latte is a refreshing twist on the classic matcha latte, combining the earthy, umami flavors of ceremonial grade matcha with the bright, citrus notes of tangerine zest. Originating from traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, matcha has become a staple in modern coffee culture due to its vibrant color and health benefits. This beverage consists of matcha powder, hot water for mixing, syrup, cold milk, ice, and a garnish of tangerine zest, resulting in a smooth, slightly sweet, and invigorating drink. According to recent market trends, matcha-based beverages have seen a 70% increase in popularity in American specialty coffee shops over the past three years.

**Equipment:**
- Matcha bowl (chawan)

- Matcha sifter
- Kettle
- Mixing measuring cup
- Serving glass (12-14 oz)
- Syrup pump or measuring spoon
- Scale
- Zester or fine grater
- Long spoon for stirring

## Instructions

1. **Sift** 4g of matcha powder into the matcha bowl to remove any clumps.
2. **Add** 30ml of hot water (175°F/80°C) to the bowl.
3. **Whisk** vigorously with the bamboo whisk in a zigzag motion for about 1 minute until the matcha is frothy and smooth, ensuring there are no clumps.
4. **Transfer** the whisked matcha into a mixing measuring cup.
5. **Rinse** the matcha bowl by adding a small amount of hot water, swirl to collect any leftover matcha, and pour this into the mixing measuring cup.
6. **Add** 19g of syrup to the mixing measuring cup.
7. **Pour** cold milk into the mixing measuring cup, bringing the total volume to approximately 266ml (9 oz).
8. **Stir** gently to combine all ingredients thoroughly.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Clumpy Matcha:**
   - **Solution:** Always sift the matcha powder before adding water and whisking. Ensure you whisk vigorously to fully dissolve the powder.
2. **Bitter Taste:**
   - **Solution:** Use water at the correct temperature (175°F/80°C). Water that is too hot can scorch the matcha, making it bitter.
3. **Weak Flavor:**
   - **Solution:** Adjust the amount of matcha powder or reduce the quantity of milk. Ensure the matcha is properly whisked to release its full flavor.
4. **Grainy Texture:**
   - **Solution:** Use high-quality ceremonial grade matcha and whisk thoroughly until smooth and frothy.
5. **Separation of Ingredients:**
   - **Solution:** Stir the drink well before serving and advise customers to stir before drinking if separation occurs.
6. **Too Sweet or Not Sweet Enough:**
   - **Solution:** Adjust the amount of syrup according to taste preferences. You can offer the option of less or extra syrup.
7. **Diluted Flavor Due to Ice Melting:**
   - **Solution:** Use larger ice cubes to slow down melting, or slightly increase the matcha and syrup concentrations to compensate.
8. **Overpowering Citrus Flavor:**
   - **Solution:** Use tangerine zest sparingly. A light sprinkle is enough to add zest without overwhelming the matcha.
9. **Milk Curdling:**
   - **Solution:** Ensure the milk is fresh and cold. Avoid adding acidic ingredients directly into the milk before mixing.
10. **Matcha Not Frothy:**
    - **Solution:** Whisk more vigorously and use a proper bamboo whisk to achieve the desired frothiness.
