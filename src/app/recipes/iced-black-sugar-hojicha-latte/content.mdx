# Iced Black Sugar Hojicha Latte

The Iced Black Sugar Hojicha Latte is a refreshing cold version of its hot counterpart, perfect for warm days or those who prefer chilled beverages. This drink combines the rich, caramel-like sweetness of black sugar syrup with the earthy, roasted notes of hojicha, a Japanese roasted green tea, served over ice and topped with cold milk. Its unique flavor profile balances sweetness, nuttiness, and a subtle smokiness, all in a cool, refreshing package. The iced version has gained popularity alongside other cold tea drinks, with many specialty cafes reporting a 45% increase in cold tea latte sales during summer months. Its appeal lies in its unique flavor combination and lower caffeine content compared to traditional iced coffee drinks.

## Common Troubleshooting

1. **Clumpy hojicha mixture**: Use a small frother or whisk vigorously. If needed, strain the mixture before adding to the cup.
2. **Syrup settling at the bottom**: Stir well before serving and provide a straw for customers to mix while drinking.
3. **Weak hojicha flavor**: Adjust the amount of hojicha powder or black sugar syrup to taste.
4. **Too sweet**: Reduce the amount of black sugar syrup or increase the hojicha powder slightly.
5. **Diluted taste**: Use larger ice cubes to slow melting, or slightly increase the concentration of hojicha and syrup.
6. **Separation of ingredients**: Stir well before serving and advise customers to stir occasionally while drinking.
7. **Inconsistent sweetness**: Use a pump bottle or precise measurements for the black sugar syrup.
8. **Grainy texture**: Ensure the hojicha powder is fully dissolved in water before adding to the cup.
9. **Drink not cold enough**: Pre-chill the glass and ensure milk is well refrigerated before use.
10. **Inconsistent drink size**: Use a marked cup or measuring tools for precise ingredient amounts.
