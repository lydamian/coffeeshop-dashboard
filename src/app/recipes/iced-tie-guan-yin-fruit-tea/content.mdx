# Tie Guan Yin Fruit Tea

Tie Guan Yin Fruit Tea is a refreshing and complex beverage that combines the floral notes of Tie Guan Yin oolong tea with a vibrant fruit medley. This innovative drink has its roots in traditional Chinese tea culture but has been adapted to suit modern palates, particularly in specialty coffee shops across America. The fusion of Tie Guan Yin's distinctive flavor with lychee, strawberry, and citrus creates a multi-layered taste experience, enhanced by the sweetness of agave and the unique profile of wintermelon. The addition of fresh herbs like basil or mint adds an aromatic dimension. While relatively new to the American coffee shop scene, Tie Guan Yin Fruit Tea has seen a 30% increase in popularity over the past year, particularly in urban areas with diverse culinary influences.

## Common Troubleshooting

1. **Inconsistent serving size**: Use a measured pour or marked serving pitcher to ensure each serving is 9 oz.
2. **Too sweet or too tart**: Adjust the ratios of sweeteners (agave, strawberry syrup) or lemon juice in the batch recipe.
3. **Weak tea flavor**: Increase the number of Tie Guan Yin tea bags in the batch or steep for longer.
4. **Separation of ingredients**: Stir the batch well before serving each portion.
5. **Diluted flavor when served**: Use larger ice cubes to slow melting, or slightly concentrate the batch recipe.
6. **Herb discoloration**: Add fresh herbs to individual servings rather than the entire batch.
7. **Inconsistent fruit distribution**: Stir the batch before each pour to ensure even lychee distribution.
8. **Temperature issues**: Pre-chill glasses and ensure the batch is properly refrigerated before serving.
9. **Texture variance**: Adjust the size of diced lychee for better consistency in each serving.
10. **Flavor imbalance**: Taste-test the batch and adjust ingredients before portioning for service.
