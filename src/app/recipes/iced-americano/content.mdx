# Iced Americano

The Iced Americano is a refreshing espresso-based beverage that combines the robust flavor of espresso with chilled water and ice. Originating as a cooler alternative to the traditional Americano, it's perfect for warm days. Made with a double shot of espresso and cold water over ice, it maintains the rich, bold taste of espresso while offering a crisp, invigorating experience. In many specialty coffee shops across America, the Iced Americano is a popular choice, accounting for about 15% of iced coffee orders.

## Ingredients and Equipment

**Ingredients:**
- Espresso beans
- Filtered water
- Ice cubes

**Equipment:**
- Espresso machine
- Coffee grinder
- Scale
- Measuring cup
- 8 oz serving glass
- Spoon

## Steps to Make the Iced Americano

1. **Prepare the Serving Glass:**
   - Fill an 8 oz serving glass with ice cubes, about halfway.
   - Pour 6 oz of cold, filtered water over the ice.

2. **Make the Espresso:**
   - Grind fresh espresso beans to a fine consistency (about 18-20 grams for a double shot).
   - Tamp the grounds evenly in the portafilter.
   - Pull a double shot of espresso (2 oz) using the espresso machine.

3. **Combine and Serve:**
   - Pour the hot espresso into a measuring cup to prevent shocking the glass.
   - Gently pour the espresso over the iced water in the serving glass.
   - Stir gently if needed.
   - Serve immediately.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Drink Tastes Too Diluted:**
   - Reduce the amount of cold water or increase the espresso volume.

2. **Espresso Is Bitter or Sour:**
   - Check the extraction time; aim for 25-30 seconds.
   - Adjust the grind size finer or coarser as needed.

3. **Ice Melts Too Quickly:**
   - Use larger ice cubes or more ice to keep the drink chilled longer.
   - Chill the espresso before combining if time allows.

4. **Layering Doesn't Occur:**
   - For aesthetic layering, pour the espresso slowly over the back of a spoon onto the iced water.

5. **Weak Flavor:**
   - Ensure you're using freshly roasted beans and the correct coffee-to-water ratio.
