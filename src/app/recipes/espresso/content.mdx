## Steps:

1. **Warm up the machine:**
   - Turn on your espresso machine and allow it to heat up (usually 15-30 minutes).
   - Run water through the group head to ensure it's hot.

2. **Prepare your portafilter:**
   - Ensure your portafilter is clean and dry.
   - Warm it by locking it into the group head briefly.

3. **Grind the coffee:**
   - Grind the amount of coffee beans calculated above.
   - Adjust grind size to be fine, similar to table salt.

4. **Dose the coffee:**
   - Place the portafilter on a scale.
   - Add the ground coffee to the portafilter.
   - Ensure even distribution in the basket.

5. **Tamp the coffee:**
   - Apply even pressure (about 30 lbs) with the tamper.
   - Aim for a level, compressed puck of coffee.

6. **Insert and brew:**
   - Lock the portafilter into the group head.
   - Start the shot immediately.
   - Place your cup under the spouts.

7. **Monitor the extraction:**
   - Watch the flow of espresso.
   - Aim for the extraction time calculated above.
   - Look for a honey-like consistency.

8. **Stop the shot:**
   - Stop the extraction when you've reached your desired output weight.

9. **Serve and enjoy:**
   - Serve immediately for best flavor and temperature.
   - Clean your equipment for the next use.

## Tips:
- Adjust grind size finer if the shot runs too fast, coarser if too slow.
- Consistently use the same tamping pressure for reproducible results.
- Always use freshly roasted beans for the best flavor.
