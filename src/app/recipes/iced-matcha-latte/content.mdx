# Iced Matcha Latte

Iced Matcha Latte is a refreshing beverage that combines the earthy, umami flavors of Japanese green tea powder with cold milk and a touch of sweetness. Originating from traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, matcha has gained popularity in Western coffee shops as a healthier alternative to coffee. This drink consists of ceremonial grade matcha powder, hot water for mixing, syrup, cold milk, and ice, resulting in a smooth, vibrant green latte with a complex flavor profile balancing sweet, creamy, and slightly bitter notes. According to recent market research, iced matcha latte sales have increased by 60% in American specialty coffee shops over the past year, reflecting its growing popularity as a refreshing and Instagram-worthy drink.

## Troubleshooting

1. Clumpy matcha: Sift the matcha powder before whisking and ensure vigorous whisking with hot water.
2. Bitter taste: Use water at 175°F (80°C), not boiling, as it can make the matcha bitter.
3. Weak flavor: Increase the amount of matcha powder slightly or reduce the milk quantity.
4. Grainy texture: Use higher quality, ceremonial grade matcha and whisk thoroughly.
5. Inconsistent color: Ensure the matcha is fully dissolved before adding milk and syrup.
6. Too sweet or not sweet enough: Adjust the amount of syrup to taste.
7. Diluted flavor: Use larger ice cubes to slow melting, or slightly increase the concentration of matcha and syrup.
8. Separation of ingredients: Stir the drink well before serving and provide a straw for customers to mix as they drink.
9. Inconsistent serving size: Use a scale and measuring cup to ensure accurate proportions of all ingredients.
10. Matcha clumping when mixed with cold milk: Always mix matcha with hot water first before adding cold ingredients.
