export const LatteCalculator = () => {
  const [espressoOz, setEspressoOz] = useState(2);
  const [steamedMilkOz, setSteamedMilkOz] = useState(8);
  const [totalVolume, setTotalVolume] = useState(steamedMilkOz + espressoOz);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTotalVolume(espressoOz + steamedMilkOz);
  }, [espressoOz, steamedMilkOz]);

  const updateValues = (type, value) => {
    switch(type) {
      case 'espresso':
        setEspressoOz(value);
        setSteamedMilkOz(10 - value);

## Ingredients and Equipment

- Espresso (see <Link href="/recipes/espresso">Espresso Recipe</Link>)
- Whole milk
- Espresso machine with steam wand
- Milk pitcher
- 10 oz latte cup

## Steps to Prepare a Latte

1. **Prepare the espresso**
   - Follow the <Link href="/recipes/espresso">Espresso Recipe</Link> to pull a 2 oz double shot

2. **Steam the milk**
   - Refer to the <Link href="/recipes/steamed-milk">Steamed Milk Guide</Link> for technique
   - Steam about 10 oz of milk to 150-160°F (65-71°C)
   - Create a smooth, velvety microfoam

3. **Combine and serve**
   - Pour the espresso into a 10 oz latte cup
   - Gently pour the steamed milk over the espresso, allowing a small layer of foam to form on top
   - Aim for a ratio of 1/6 espresso to 5/6 steamed milk

## Latte Art

Latte art is a hallmark of specialty coffee shops:

1. Start with the cup at a slight angle
2. Pour the milk steadily into the center of the espresso
3. As the cup fills, bring the pitcher closer to the surface
4. Create patterns by moving the pour in a steady motion
5. Finish with a gentle cut through for more intricate designs

## Tips for the Perfect Specialty Latte

1. **Espresso quality**: Use freshly roasted, high-quality beans and dial in your grind and extraction
2. **Milk texture**: Focus on creating silky, velvety microfoam without large bubbles
3. **Temperature**: Serve immediately for the best flavor and latte art potential
4. **Balance**: Maintain the correct ratio of espresso to milk for a balanced flavor
5. **Consistency**: Practice your milk steaming and pouring techniques regularly

Remember, a great latte is about the harmony between the espresso and the silky steamed milk, with the latte art as the finishing touch.
