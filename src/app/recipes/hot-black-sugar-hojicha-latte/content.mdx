# Hot Black Sugar Hojicha Latte

The Hot Black Sugar Hojicha Latte is a unique fusion of East Asian flavors in a comforting, warm beverage. This innovative drink combines the rich, caramel-like sweetness of black sugar syrup with the earthy, roasted notes of hojicha, a Japanese roasted green tea. Topped with creamy steamed milk, it offers a complex flavor profile balancing sweetness, nuttiness, and a subtle smokiness. Originating in specialty tea shops in Japan, this latte has gained popularity in American coffee shops over the past few years, with a 35% increase in sales reported by specialty cafes in urban areas. Its appeal lies in its unique flavor combination and lower caffeine content compared to traditional coffee-based lattes.

## Steps to Make the Drink

1. Preheat a 12 oz ceramic cup with hot water, then discard the water.
2. In a small measuring cup, combine 4g of hojicha powder with 30ml of hot water.
3. Whisk the hojicha mixture vigorously until it's well combined and smooth.
4. Pour 19g of black sugar syrup into the preheated ceramic cup.
5. Add the hojicha mixture to the cup with the black sugar syrup and stir to combine.
6. Steam approximately 7 oz of milk to 150째F (65째C), creating a velvety microfoam.
7. Slowly pour the steamed milk into the cup, starting from a height to incorporate the hojicha and syrup mixture.
8. As the cup fills, lower the milk pitcher closer to the surface to create latte art.
9. Continue pouring until the total volume reaches 8-9 oz.
10. Serve immediately and enjoy!

## Common Troubleshooting

1. **Clumpy hojicha mixture**: Ensure you're using hot water and whisk vigorously. If needed, strain the mixture before adding to the cup.
2. **Syrup not mixing well**: Stir the syrup and hojicha mixture thoroughly before adding milk.
3. **Bitter taste**: Adjust the amount of black sugar syrup or check if the hojicha powder is fresh.
4. **Weak hojicha flavor**: Increase the amount of hojicha powder slightly, up to 5g.
5. **Milk too hot or cold**: Aim for 150째F (65째C) for optimal taste and texture.
6. **Latte art difficulties**: Ensure milk is properly steamed with fine microfoam and pour slowly.
7. **Inconsistent sweetness**: Use a pump bottle or precise measurements for the black sugar syrup.
8. **Separation of ingredients**: Stir gently before drinking if separation occurs.
9. **Grainy texture**: Make sure the hojicha powder is fully dissolved in hot water before adding to the cup.
10. **Inconsistent drink size**: Use a marked pitcher or measure the milk precisely before steaming.
