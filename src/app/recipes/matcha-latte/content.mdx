## Ingredients and Equipment

- High-quality matcha powder (1-2 tsp)
- Hot water (1-2 oz)
- Whole milk (or plant-based alternative)
- Bamboo whisk (chasen) or electric frother
- Matcha bowl (chawan) or small bowl
- Espresso machine with steam wand or milk frother
- 12 oz cup

## Steps to Prepare a Matcha Latte

1. **Prepare the matcha**
   - Sift 1-2 tsp of matcha powder into a matcha bowl or small bowl
   - Add 1-2 oz of hot water (175째F/80째C)
   - Whisk vigorously in a "W" motion until the matcha is fully dissolved and slightly frothy

2. **Steam the milk**
   - Refer to the <Link href="/recipes/steamed-milk">Steamed Milk Guide</Link> for technique
   - Steam about 10-11 oz of milk to 150-160째F (65-71째C)
   - Create a smooth, velvety microfoam

3. **Combine and serve**
   - Pour the prepared matcha into a 12 oz cup
   - Gently pour the steamed milk over the matcha, allowing a small layer of foam to form on top
   - Use a spoon to add any remaining foam to the top of the drink

## Tips for the Perfect Matcha Latte

1. **Matcha quality**: Use high-grade, ceremonial matcha for the best flavor and color
2. **Water temperature**: Use water that's hot but not boiling to avoid bitterness
3. **Whisking technique**: Whisk briskly to fully dissolve the matcha and create a smooth texture
4. **Milk choice**: Whole milk creates a rich latte, but plant-based milks like oat or almond can be great alternatives
5. **Sweetener**: Matcha can be slightly bitter; offer optional sweeteners on the side

Remember, a great matcha latte should have a vibrant green color, smooth texture, and balanced flavor between the earthy matcha and creamy milk.
