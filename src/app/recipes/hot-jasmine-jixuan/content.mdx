## Ingredients and Equipment

### Ingredients:
- Jasmine Jixuan loose leaf tea
- Filtered water

### Equipment:
- Electric kettle or stovetop kettle
- Thermometer (if kettle doesn't have temperature control)
- Teapot or Gaiwan
- Tea cup or mug
- Tea strainer (if not using a Gaiwan)
- Scale for measuring tea leaves

## Steps to Make Hot Jasmine Jixuan

1. **Heat Water**: Bring water to 175°F (80°C). This lower temperature helps preserve the delicate flavors of the green tea and jasmine.

2. **Measure Tea Leaves**: Weigh 6g of Jasmine Jixuan tea leaves and place them in your teapot or Gaiwan.

3. **Bloom the Leaves**: Pour a small amount (about 30ml) of hot water over the tea leaves to rinse and awaken them. Let it sit for 20 seconds, then discard this water.

4. **Steep the Tea**: Pour the remaining 150ml of hot water over the tea leaves.

5. **Steeping Time**: Allow the tea to steep for 2 minutes.

6. **Serve**: Strain the tea into a cup if necessary and serve immediately.

7. **Additional Infusions**: Jasmine Jixuan leaves can be re-steeped 2-3 times. Increase steeping time by 30 seconds for each subsequent infusion.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Tea is too bitter**: This may be due to water that's too hot or over-steeping. Use water at 175°F (80°C) and reduce steeping time if necessary.

2. **Flavor is too weak**: Ensure you're using the correct amount of tea leaves and that the water temperature is sufficient. You can also extend the steeping time by 30 seconds.

3. **Tea is cloudy**: This can happen if the water temperature is too high. Make sure the water isn't exceeding 175°F (80°C).

4. **Leaves don't fully open**: This is normal for some green teas. Gently stir the leaves during steeping or extend the steeping time slightly.

5. **Tea tastes flat**: Use freshly filtered water and ensure your tea leaves are stored properly to maintain freshness.

6. **Astringent aftertaste**: This can result from over-steeping or using too many tea leaves. Adjust the steeping time or reduce the amount of tea leaves slightly.

Remember, brewing the perfect cup may require slight adjustments based on personal taste preferences and the specific characteristics of the tea batch.
