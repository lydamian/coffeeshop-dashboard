## Common Troubleshooting

1. **Drink too diluted**: Use less ice or pour espresso over the ice quickly to minimize melting.
2. **Syrup not mixing well**: Stir more thoroughly, or mix syrup with espresso before adding to ice.
3. **Espresso too bitter**: Check extraction time and grind size; consider using a slightly coarser grind for iced drinks.
4. **Drink not cold enough**: Ensure milk and cup are well chilled before preparation.
5. **Inconsistent sweetness**: Use a pump bottle or precise measurements for syrup.
6. **Separation of ingredients**: Stir well and encourage customers to stir occasionally while drinking.
7. **Weak coffee flavor**: Use a slightly stronger espresso shot or adjust the espresso-to-milk ratio.
8. **Too sweet**: Adjust vanilla syrup amount to taste.
9. **Inconsistent drink size**: Use a marked cup or measuring tools for precise ingredient amounts.
