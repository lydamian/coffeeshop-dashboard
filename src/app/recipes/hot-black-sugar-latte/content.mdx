## Preparation Steps

1. Grind coffee beans for a double shot of espresso (about 18-20 grams).
2. Pull a double shot of espresso (2 oz) into a shot glass.
3. In a 12 oz mug, add 19 grams of black sugar syrup.
4. Pour the freshly pulled espresso over the black sugar syrup and stir to combine.
5. Steam 7 oz of milk to 150-160°F (65-70°C), creating a velvety microfoam.
6. Slowly pour the steamed milk into the mug, starting from a height to cut through the espresso, then lowering the pitcher to create latte art if desired.
7. The final drink should yield approximately 10 oz.
8. Serve immediately.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Drink is too sweet**: Reduce the amount of black sugar syrup or increase the espresso quantity slightly.

2. **Syrup doesn't mix well**: Ensure the espresso is hot and stir thoroughly before adding milk.

3. **Inconsistent flavor**: Use a precision scale to measure the black sugar syrup accurately.

4. **Latte art doesn't form**: Check milk steaming technique, ensure proper microfoam consistency, and practice pouring technique.

5. **Espresso tastes bitter or sour**: Adjust grind size and extraction time. Aim for a 25-30 second extraction for the double shot.

6. **Milk tastes burnt**: Lower steaming temperature slightly and avoid overheating.

7. **Drink is too cold**: Preheat the mug with hot water before preparing the drink.

Remember, consistency is key in specialty coffee. Always measure ingredients precisely and pay attention to temperatures and timings to ensure a high-quality Hot Black Sugar Latte every time.
