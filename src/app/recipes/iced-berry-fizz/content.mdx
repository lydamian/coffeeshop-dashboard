# Iced Berry Fizz

The Iced Berry Fizz is a refreshing, non-caffeinated beverage that has gained popularity in specialty coffee shops as a fruity alternative. This drink combines the sweet and tart flavors of mixed berries with the effervescence of sparkling water, creating a vibrant and refreshing experience. Originating from the trend of craft sodas and artisanal beverages, the Iced Berry Fizz offers a perfect balance of fruitiness and fizz. Made with house-made berry syrup, fresh berry pieces, and sparkling water, it delivers a bright, crisp flavor profile with a hint of natural sweetness. In many American specialty coffee shops, fruit-based fizzy drinks like the Iced Berry Fizz account for about 10-15% of non-coffee beverage orders, especially during summer months.

## Ingredients and Equipment

Ingredients:
- Mixed berry syrup
- Fresh berries from syrup
- Sparkling water
- Ice cubes

Equipment:
- 12-16 oz serving glass
- Measuring cup
- Digital scale
- Bar spoon or long stirring spoon
- Ice scoop
- Strainer (optional, for removing seeds from syrup if desired)

## Steps to Make an Iced Berry Fizz

1. Fill the serving glass about halfway with ice cubes.
2. Place the glass on a digital scale and tare it to zero.
3. Pour 30g of mixed berry syrup over the ice.
4. Add 15g of berry fruit pieces from the syrup.
5. Fill the glass with sparkling water to reach a total of 270ml (9 oz).
6. Gently stir with a bar spoon to mix the ingredients without losing too much carbonation.
7. Garnish with a few fresh berries or a lemon wedge if desired.
8. Serve immediately with a straw.

## Troubleshooting

1. Drink is too sweet: Reduce the amount of berry syrup or increase the sparkling water slightly.

2. Not sweet enough: Increase the amount of berry syrup or add a small amount of simple syrup.

3. Lack of fizz: Ensure you're using fresh, well-carbonated sparkling water. Pour gently to preserve carbonation.

4. Too many seeds: If the berry pieces are bothersome, strain the syrup before use or use a fine-mesh strainer when adding the fruit.

5. Inconsistent flavor: Use a scale to measure the syrup and fruit precisely each time. Ensure your house-made syrup is well mixed before use.

6. Separation of syrup and water: Stir gently before serving. If separation continues, try mixing the syrup with a small amount of still water before adding sparkling water.

7. Drink is too watery: Use larger ice cubes that melt more slowly, or slightly increase the amount of syrup and fruit.

8. Color is not vibrant enough: Ensure you're using fresh, colorful berries in your syrup. You can also add a small amount of butterfly pea flower tea for a natural blue color that turns purple when mixed with the berry syrup.

9. Flat taste: Add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to brighten the flavors if the drink tastes dull.
