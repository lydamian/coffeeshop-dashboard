# Iced Banana Milk

Iced Banana Milk is a refreshing and creamy beverage that combines the sweet, tropical flavor of bananas with cold milk. This drink, inspired by the popular Korean banana milk (banana uyu), has gained traction in specialty coffee shops across America. It offers a delightful alternative to traditional coffee-based drinks, appealing to both kids and adults alike. The drink's flavor profile is predominantly sweet and banana-forward, with a smooth, creamy texture from the milk. While not as common as classic espresso drinks, Iced Banana Milk has seen a surge in popularity, especially during summer months, with some shops reporting it makes up about 5-10% of their non-coffee drink orders.

## Ingredients and Equipment

Ingredients:
- Banana syrup
- Cold milk (whole, 2%, or non-dairy alternative)
- Ice cubes

Equipment:
- 12 oz serving cup
- Measuring cup
- Scale
- Ice scoop
- Long spoon for stirring
- Straw (optional)

## Steps to Make an Iced Banana Milk

1. Place the measuring cup on the scale and tare it to zero.
2. Pour 30g of banana syrup into the measuring cup.
3. Add cold milk to the measuring cup until it reaches the 9 oz (267 ml) mark.
4. Stir well to combine the syrup and milk.
5. Fill the serving cup about halfway with ice.
6. Pour the banana milk mixture over the ice.
7. Stir gently to chill the drink and serve immediately.

Note: For a kid's size (6 oz), use 20g of banana syrup and fill with milk to the 6 oz (178 ml) mark.

## Troubleshooting

1. Too sweet: Reduce the amount of banana syrup or increase the milk quantity slightly.

2. Not sweet enough: Increase the amount of banana syrup or decrease the milk quantity slightly.

3. Inconsistent flavor: Use a scale to measure the banana syrup precisely each time.

4. Separation: Stir well before serving. If separation continues, check if the banana syrup has expired or needs shaking.

5. Too thick: If using a particularly thick syrup, you may need to adjust the ratios slightly or stir more vigorously.

6. Too thin: Ensure you're using the correct amount of syrup and not over-diluting with milk or ice melt.

7. Banana flavor too weak: Some syrups may be less concentrated. You might need to adjust the amount used or consider changing brands.

8. Clumping: If the syrup clumps at the bottom, try mixing the syrup with a small amount of warm milk first before adding the rest of the cold milk.
