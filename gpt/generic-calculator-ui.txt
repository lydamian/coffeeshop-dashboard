Hi I am using nextjs, typescript, tailwindcss, shadcdnui, mdx
for an internal tools app for training barista's in a specialty coffee shop
called ru coffee bar.

Help me make a generic component that will essentially be a ratio calculator
for different coffee drinks.

I want the behavior to be like so for example

it should take all inputs and ratios and output a calculator UI where any changes to one input should automatically trigger changes to all the other variables
in a ratio formula given. Remember inputs can have different units of measurement
