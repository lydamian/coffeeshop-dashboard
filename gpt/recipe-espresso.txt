Hi I am using nextjs, typescript, tailwindcss, shadcdnui, mdx
for an internal tools app for training barista's in a specialty coffee shop
called ru coffee bar.

But please make the default values, the normal values for a specialty coffee shop in America.

Help me create a mdx file for:

Steps on how to prepare espresso.

Please keep in mind the ratios.

Please make all variables toggleable as form inputs (e.g input coffee grams, changes to one should change the other variables )
But please make the default values, the normal values for a specialty coffee shop in America.


For puck preperation, some things to note that we do differently is
we grind in a dosing up,
then shake it vigorously left to right, before transferring to a portafilter.
Once in the porta filter and before removing the dosing cup we tap the edge in a circular fashion
to evenly distribute the espresso.

then remvoe the dosing cup.

Tap to make the espresso even
then use ncd tool
then tamp

Please always put tips at the end for how to trouble shoot and make the best cup of espresso
