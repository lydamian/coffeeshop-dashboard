Hi I am using nextjs, typescript, tailwindcss, shadcdnui, mdx
for an internal tools app for training barista's in a specialty coffee shop
called ru coffee bar.

I want to create a speed run feature that will allow me to train my baristas.

Inputs will be a dynamic list of users,
the number of drinks i want to randomly sample.
Output will be a UI that is a single list of drinks that can be marked
The ability for a user to mark a drink as completed, or unmark it if they accidently marked it

so the way that i want the timer to work, is i want to keep track when i mark a drink as completed that it will keep track of how long it took to make that drink
which should be elapsedTime between current time and the time it took to complete the latest drink,
so for each drink we should keep track of when we started it, when we finished it and elapsed time.

we want to keep track of this information for all drinks and not just have a latestTime variable because in the case that i
unmark a drink in the future and mark it completed again, we can simply take the elapsed time anew.

also for elapsed time we should keep a timer for each user to account for parallelism, or whatever is a good strategy for this otherwise,
if we only have one timer, and we both finish a drink at the same time wouldn't one drink have a elapsed time of 0 to make the drink which
will look odd in the summary

A button to finish the speed run
after finishing speed run i want to output
a summary
total time,
details for each drink such as how long it took
and feedback, for the feedback please make it as robust as possible based on any metrics we can gather

lets use a drinks.json file that looks like so

This code is called speed run and it essentially allows us to
start a speed run which will select n random drinks and a timer, and allow us
to simulate customers ordering when we finish a drink we can click complete
once all drinks are finished we get a summary of the results.

I love this but i want to add some additional functionality to it, namely
i want us to be able to mark a drink as not completed if i accidently completed it, this likely
means we need a more robust way to keep track of time since just keeping track of the last time wont Work
we need to keep an array of time taken for each drink, and likely cycle through all the drinks to get the latest time.Array

Secondly i want to add a feature such that i can also insert n usernames, and then when i start the speed run
it will split the drinks between the users, meaning it needs to start a timer for each user and keep track of the time
and a speed run will be complete when either both user's have finished all their drink or we click finish, meaning we weren't able to finish all the drinks
and then we get a summary of the results for each user as well as a total time taken for all the drinks.

I also love the feedback system, if you can make it more robust and capture more states that would be amazing



also be sure to save the state to localstorage so if i accidently click out i can have my state saved
