so basically
inputs are
- timer
- how many drinks you want to practice - N
- when you click submit it selects N random drinks from the input above,
and creates a list view where it shows the drink it wants you to make and a check mark button
when you click a check mark button it means you finished it, and that state should be reflected in the UI, also after pressing the checkmark button it should show the elapsed time
since you made your last drink (the last checkmark) or when we started the timer if none

After selecting the last drink or clicking a Done button it will display an aggregrate of the results
- average time it took to make each drinks
- any drinks we were not able to make
- total time
- and a list of how long each drink it took to make

i am using tailwindcss, shadcdnui and nextjs.
