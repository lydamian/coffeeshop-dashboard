Hi I am using nextjs, typescript, tailwindcss, shadcdnui, mdx
for an internal tools app for training barista's in a specialty coffee shop
called ru coffee bar.

But please make the default values, the normal values for a specialty coffee shop in America.

Help me create a mdx file for:

Steps on how to prepare cortado.

Please keep in mind the ratios.

I want all the inputs to be toggleable and to automatically update related inputs via a porportion or mathematical formula,
whatever is standard in industry,

I want to know how to inputs change the output of cotado drinks.

I think inputs should be amount of espresso and milk, to output of drink

Any information im missing please include it.
Please also talk about how to do standard cortado art if it applies.
